# Uncovering-the-World-s-Oldest-Businesses---Python-Project

In this project, I have explored data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses. I haved used  joining and data manipulation techniques to answer questions about these historic businesses.



Q1:
What is the oldest business on each continent? Save your answer as a DataFrame called oldest_business_continent with four columns: continent, country, business, and year_founded in any order.

Q2:
How many countries per continent lack data on the oldest businesses? Does including new_businesses change this? 
Count the number of countries per continent missing business data, including new_businesses, and store the results in a DataFrame named count_missing with columns for the continent and the count.

Q3:
Which business categories are best suited to last many years, and on what continent are they? 
Create a DataFrame called oldest_by_continent_category that stores the oldest founding year for each continent and category combination. It should contain three columns: continent, category, and year_founded, in that order.
